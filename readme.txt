This is the basic game we used to play when we were kids.

In this we used to show hand sign whether it is a scissor , Paper or rock.

Basic rule of the game :

Paper>Rock>Scissor>Paper


Paper wins over Rock
Rock Wins over Scissor
Scissor wins over Paper


This the Angular demo in playful way :

Player 1 is user that selects the option and
Player 2 is a computer that gets the random option.

Logic computes the result in simple way.
